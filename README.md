# Summary

HOMEWORK 1 
I am learning to use KiCAd.   
I have made my first PCB in KiCad by following Robert's Feranec tutorial. This PCB lights up an LED.

## Details
* This project has no firmware.
* An printed circuit assembly where a LED can be lit.
* I am following a Tutorial by Robert Feranec.  See: https://youtu.be/maaBkw7IRUc?si=Xxvh67IJcYb2y9pr  
* I learned how to make schematic symbols
* I learned how to make PCB footprints.
* I learned how to make local schematic symbol library.
* I learned how to make local PCB footrpint library.
* I learned how to switch layers for placing traces.


## Instructions 
### Tools list:
* tweeezers
* Ring magnifying 
* soldeting iron
* assembly surface 
* solder
* pen, (sharpies, that can write on the PCB.)

### Detailed Assembly Instructions
* Write a serial nummber on the board.
* Use tweezers to place SMT parts on their footprints and, solder.
* PLace the header pins into the holes of the printed circuit board and turn it upside down and solder from the bottom side.
  
### Instruction for connection for microcontroller kit
* Connect pin 1 of the connector to GPIO pin.
* Connect pin 2 to GND.
* Firmware makes GPIO pin high to turn on LED.
